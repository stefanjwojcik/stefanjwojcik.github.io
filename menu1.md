# Research!

![a descriptive caption](/images/nebula.png)

Please check out my [Github](https://github.com/stefanjwojcik) for apps and code that I'm working on,
and follow me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com) at @stefanjwojcik.

My research applies data science tools and methods to social science research questions.
My work involves using digital trace or social media data to understand the flow of information online,
public opinion and behavior. I received my Ph.D. in political science from the University of Colorado,
 where I conducted research on legislative networks in Brazil. In my postdoctoral research at Northeastern
 and Harvard universities, my work focused on forecasting global presidential elections and tracing public
 opinion with social media data. My work appears in academic journals such as Science, Political
 Science Research and Methods, Political Research Quarterly and Legislative Studies Quarterly.


### Pew Research Articles

I worked for 2.5 years at Pew Research Center. PRC is a great organization and I received
excellent training and mentorship there. They have a commitment to honest and high-quality
research.

You can see a complete list of projects I worked on at PRC [here](https://www.pewresearch.org/staff/stefan-wojcik/).
