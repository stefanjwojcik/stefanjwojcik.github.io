# Hello!

![alt text](/images/stefanheadshot.jpg)

My name is Stefan Wojcik, and I am Principal Data Scientist at [National Grid Renewables](nationalgridrenewables.com). I received my PhD from the University of Colorado in 2015 with concentrations in Comparative Politics and Methodology. At the University of Colorado, I worked at the Institute of Behavioral Science in the European Union Center of Excellence.

Before National Grid Renewables, I was a Staff Data Scientist at Twitter. And before that, I was a Computational Social Scientist at the Pew Research Center. I completed a postdoctoral fellowship as an affiliate of Northeastern University and Harvard IQSS in David Lazer's lab.

I am involved in a variety of research projects at the moment, so please see my CV for specifics, or drop me an email. Please feel free to contact me with any questions or [consulting requests](https://nanocentury-ai.github.io/web/).
